# toxic-text-tflite-tutorial

I followed the text classification tutorial for TensorFlow Lite to learn how to create a message moderation system on mobile. I have not yet tested it in a practical setting.

I used Google Colaboratory to follow the tutorial. Colaboratory was a great experience, aside from when the runtime kept stopping. I found [a script on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57113226/how-to-prevent-google-colab-from-disconnecting "StackOverflow link") to enter in the browser console to keep the runtime going.

This was also my first time following a Python tutorial. I find the syntax intriguing.
